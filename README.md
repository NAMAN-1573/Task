## Features

- Display vehicles on a Google Map using custom icons.
- Show real-time vehicle movement from source to destination.
- Draw the route taken by each vehicle.
- Use different colors for different vehicles.
- Smooth, continuous movement of vehicles along their routes.

## Technologies Used

- React.js
- Google Maps JavaScript API
- React Icons
- Node.js (for the backend API)

### Google Maps API Key

You need a Google Maps API key to use the Google Maps JavaScript API.

1. Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
2. Create a new project or select an existing one.
3. Go to the **APIs & Services** > **Credentials** page.
